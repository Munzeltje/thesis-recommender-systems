# Thesis-Recommender-Systems
This is the code I used for my MSc AI thesis at UvA. Data required to run the code is not included, because part of it is private data that may not be shared and the part that is openly available is to large to be uploaded to Github.

In the subdirectories you will find code for the models that I used, including the script used to train the neural approach GRU4REC (Devooght, R., & Bersini, H. 2016). The script evaluation.py is the script I used to evaluate the models' online performance.
